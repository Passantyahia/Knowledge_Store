                <h1>Philosophy and Psychology</h1>
                <p>Philosophy shares with psychology the fact that they are trying to dive into the depths of man and his secrets, and this partnership is evident in the attempt of both of them to answer the question of who am I? And linking man with his surroundings, for with regard to philosophy and psychology, man cannot be separated from his environment, and his thoughts and behaviors cannot be understood away from the social milieu to which he belongs. On the other hand, psychology is only a science derived from philosophy. They were philosophers.</p>

                <p>Religion is divided into two parts; Religion is either heavenly, or it is human-made, and scholars have defined heavenly religion by saying: It is a divine ordinance that drives those with understanding to goodness, by their praiseworthy choice. To the sane, with the exception of the one who has lost his mind due to his young age or insanity. As for the one who has lost his mind, he will be held accountable for his action, because his action leads to deviation from religiosity. Oneself and with others, and religiosity cannot be defined as performing acts of worship such as prayer, fasting, and other acts of worship in isolation from human behaviour.</p>

                <p>The ability to communicate with people is one of the most important human aspects. When a person is able to communicate with another in his own language, it is considered a wonderful gift for him. Bilinguals have a unique opportunity for their ability to communicate with a wider group of people, whether in their personal lives. Or professionalism, just as the individualâ€™s mastery of the language makes him feel that he is in his homeland, regardless of his place of residence, which opens the world wide for him, literally and figuratively.</p>

                <p>Human sciences vary from various knowledge, information, and applications that the world has witnessed since ancient times until now. These sciences are concerned with studying information, activities, and phenomena related to humans, interpreting and analyzing them, and realizing the relationship between humans and other creatures or phenomena. Geography is concerned with weather or meteorology, for example. History, with its interest in the news of the previous peoples, is one of the most important sciences, studies and research that man has undertaken.</p>
